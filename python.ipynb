If change of type is the same as type, then the adjustment is typed `(many In Out Out) → In` (well, `adjust` passes 3 arguments and not 1 tuple, so we'll need a thin extra layer: `_SingleFunc`).    \n",
    "Assuming here that generation is equally possible in both directions, and that every type implicitly includes `None`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alright, generation is simple enough. But what's a good optimizer for what is generated here?    \n",
    "Clearly, adjustment is used for static-structure learning, so we need to measure that.    \n",
    "Static learning: repeat `fit_dataset` *some* count of times (100?), then return *some* measure of fitness (the final loss, or the average loss, or some other numbers→number function I can't prescribe; all divided by time taken, to measure speed).    \n",
    "This is used in dynamic learning: remember the past, do a random change, get fitness, go back if didn't improve, update if improved. (Local search, as described in `help(Past)`.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Your keen eye instantly thinks that those *some*s above exist to be learned, to be inlined and fiddled with in some greater context to get more performance on some tasks. That's true, but we won't do that now. Still, good job catching that.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, it should be said that the result of static learning will always be random in some sense, so there's no guarantee that dynamic learning will improve an objective interpretation of what it optimizes, and it could easily be thrown off by outliers. Ideally, it should sometimes re-calculate best fitness, to average errors out; we don't do that here."

    "The best we can do is try to see what each choice means, to know what's the best one.    \n",
    "To get so far, your choices must have made you something special.    \n",
    "But don't forget to take a nice relaxing break.\n",
    "\n",

    "There was `match_id` in the previous section, so we have some experience with pattern-matching.\n",

    "Crafty hacker, do you prefer the hollowness of a specific definition, warts and bugs and all… or the richness of what it's supposed to be?    \n",
    "`one(…)` represents a union type. These are an essential part of representing all data types in an elegant language: say, <code>Tree<b>(</b>a<b>)</b> = <b>one(</b>null, Ent<b>(</b>a, Tree<b>(</b>a<b>)</b>, Tree<b>(</b>a<b>)))</b></code> specifies a tree: either nothing, or a node with data typed `a` and two tree children. (Or, if we don't have to worry about doing the same work twice (for example, pure function results are cached, and generation can remember same-type values), then this is a DAG (directed acyclic graph) type.)    \n",
    "Many pretty languages have been build on this paradigm. But what about a generative lens of view?\n",
    "- A function that returns such a `Tree` can pick any branch and likely recurse on itself to create an arbitrary DAG. It can potentially learn to extract a good structure from non-structural input. (For this, `AutoFunc` ought to add itself to its context, and generation should filter away the boring `f(x) = f(x)` trivial-infinite-loop cases. Execution should be resilient to non-trivial infinite loops, but `Limit` does that already.)\n",
    "- A function that takes such a DAG pattern-matches each case in any way. If it also takes and returns the same type (probably a `real` named `ascent_estimate`) with a merging operation, then that's half of `rewrite` right there (`ae = ascent(node, ae_sum)`). (Proper descent, which requires descending into a child only after all its parents gave it estimates, doesn't seem plausible in pure function call regime, and needs tricky-to-generate dict wizardry. …Maybe we could translate `one` inputs into `rewrite`s? How, though?)\n",
    "- A function that takes and returns such a DAG (and a soft `real`) is an arbitrary rewrite rule, optimizable to return the best-performing DAG and its performance.\n",
    "- Functions from and to a generative type of all types, in particular product and union and singleton types, would contain all lists, all DAGs, all execution models, all programs, all behavior, all meaning, all awareness. (This one should probably wait until after we can easily specify more fiddlable choices than `random.randint(0,9) == 0`.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Pretty, but an optimization nightmare compared to `rewrite`.    \n",
    "(But maybe, eventually, it's better to switch to that, to allow different flow, such as \"try several times and pick the best\"? It needs really advanced optimization techniques that I haven't seen, possibly even including proofs. What's better: painstakingly specifying a dependent-type structure, or learning something that behaves like it?)\n",

    "But just one direction isn't enough: if an input's result is uncertain, generation of output must happen only after the uncertainty has been pattern-matched away.    \n",
    "The `renn` example already had a function that dispatches based on object id (named `matcher`). We'd like to have that here too, in `match_id(generate_as)`.\n",

    "Let's remember what we want: repeatedly change a DAG structure in some way, and evaluate each structure, to find the best. The 'change' are rewriting rules, 'evaluate' is train for 100 epochs or something like it, but this is the overall gist.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have state, transitions on it, and we want to maximize a final value. You know what this reminds me of? MuZero.\n",
    "\n",
    "MuZero is an algorithm for playing games. The 'game' here means \"given state (of a Go board, etc) and action (where to place the stone), give new state and reward (whether lost/won/playing)\", where we want to maximize the cumulative (or final) reward (after transitioning between states).    \n",
    "That algorithm does that by learning the virtualization of state into a numeric representation, learning state transition, and learning search results. Very neat: everything virtualized.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the surface level, it's very similar to what happens in local search, so maybe it could be used there. But details are… complicated.\n",
    "\n",
    "To formalize what we want a little bit: we have some data structure (code), the ability to run it (giving us whether a program compiles and its fitness) and to change it (which can modify any part).    \n",
    "(This is a tad more exciting than playing games: what if our code representation is Turing-complete, and the system can learn to write better versions of itself?)\n",
    "\n",
    "Immediately, there is a problem: there isn't a finite set of actions that we can do. So let's look at what we actually have.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We have a DAG given by recursive arrays, and we descend into it then ascend, and when we ascend, we can choose to either keep the node the same or make it into any one of `Context.enum(Context.typeof(node))`, which can create a new instance or choose an old DAG. (Note that now, we shouldn't ever call `Context.get` ourselves, but instead return `finish(type)` in the graph, to give the parent control over the choice.)    \n",
    "So we have a finite choice. But it's a local choice, whereas the search happens on global results.    \n",
    "There is only one possibility here: to predict the global policy/fitness locally.    \n",
    "Locally, we have numeric ascent/descent estimates and message from descent to ascent, but we also must condition on the option.\n",
    "2. There are several kinds of options we'll see: a DAG structure, and an object with a unique ID (such as a type that generates structure). A recursive NN should handle structure, and a separate numeric variable should be created for each unique object.    \n",
    "A lot of these structures are mostly shared, so we need to cache them. We'll need a recursive NN that only ascends, as it does not depend on the entry point.    \n",
    "We should have a function that produces a function that can be called on an option: `option_handler(feature_size)(option)`. Also, `rewrite` should call `ascend` on non-structs, for uniformity and to store more state.\n",
    "3. Built-in functions are black-box, and can be pattern-matched by object ID to have their own NNs. But what about white-box sub-functions?    \n",
    "We could treat these as black-boxes too, learning the role for each function separately, but this won't be able to predict post-change things.    \n",
    "We need to recurse into bodies of these little devils. Which means that we need to rebrand `ascend` into \"given descent estimate, give ascent estimate\".    \n",
    "Function bodies are acyclic, but for arbitrary recursion, functions themselves can be cyclic. We can either take inspiration from graph NNs and do several iterations of message-passing on the function graph (can't easily imagine how to *not* upend all control flow with this), or for cyclic references, have 1 or more sub-estimators that predict the final ascent estimate, or just make currently-being-handled references pass their message through.    \n",
    "Now, I know that people are supposed to spend tens of thousands of hours on things that don't pan out, but I *think* I'm attracted to the last option.\n",
    "\n",
    "With all that, we *should* be able to predict global estimates locally and search for the best option. With a good enough model, we could do many rewrites without evaluating, to arrive to the best option and just evaluate that once.    \n",
    "It may be slow to do a search 1000 times per rewrite, but, you know, **compute**. Pretty sure that it can learn to be *much* better than things like evolution, especially if trained on a Turing-complete function set, and every program and goal are specified using those. I don't see any better way to do arbitrary white-box optimization that is necessary for general AI; do you?\n",
    "\n",
    "If it bleeds, we can kill it. So, I'll recap what I'll do, and you can follow along if you like:\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ `rewrite` should call `ascend` on non-structs. For this, just put non-structs into `_postorder` and push the struct check onto its users.    \n",
    "(Later, changed `_postorder` back to contain only structs, for efficiency of evaluation. Didn't end up using `rewrite` after all.)    \n",
    "✅ Everything that uses `rewrite` (from Ctrl+F, `regen_t` in `test_rs_1`, and `matcher` in `renn`, and `regenerate`'s `_regen_node` and `_clear_body`) should handle non-structs properly too.    \n",
    "✅ Re-run and test everything.\n",
    "\n",
    "Behind this format lies an effective task executioner. Nurture.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Ctrl+F `Context.get` to gauge the plausibility of inverting control over replacing.    \n",
    "The only odd cases are `access_many` and `_dense_layer_of_concat` (which uses `Context.finish` to pick every enumeration at once); probably good to leave as-is.    \n",
    "❎ Have a class `of_type(Type)` as a replacement for `Context.get` for structs returned from `.finish`, rewrite that in `Context.finish` into instances of the type, and change all `Context.get` to this.    \n",
    "A way to rewrite that is to have `depth=1` parameter to this `finish`, make users remember to pass in the proper value in uncommon situations, and have a global variable in `Context.finish` for max depth.    \n",
    "Another way to rewrite that is to maintain a set of node id in `rewrite` (or any other user of `Context.get`/`Context.finish`), and check that constantly (and set it in a global var). Dict/set stores are less efficient than just postorder, but this is a much more general/convenient way to not go into already-seen things.    \n",
    "✅ Have `with _Seen():` (used in `rewrite` and all `.has`-needing places) and `_Seen.set(k,v)`/`.get`/`.has` for the above."

    "You could say that functions exist only in the space of all their possible inputs, connected to their outputs by execution; in other words, one adjustment only follows one execution.

    "After fixing control flow, only one thread of execution exists, so we only need one tape (one list).    \n",

    "\n",
    "In formal analyses of AGI, it's common to analyse the average case. But arbitrary-program optimization picks the best instead of a random choice, so such an analysis is useless. It can do anything and be anything, as long as its basic functionality set is Turing-complete and efficient.\n",

    "- Evaluating the approach on searching for MetaMath proofs, and on AutoML.\n",
