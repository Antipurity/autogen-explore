    "Once again, the problem it's used on is too simple. But at least it technically works, sometimes.\n",

    "Do you know knowing? A learned thing, no? Even fundamental things are actually learned.\n",
    "\n",
    "I would like to be able to learn completely arbitrary functions and their adjustments. Technically, we've already covered functions (but the output should be typed `...`), but generating adjustment (and optimizing how fast the result learns) is not well-understood.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the interface: `class BasicFunc` that is just like `AutoFunc`, but has an extra exposed switch for when-to-change-adjustment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say that we have a function typed `In → Out`. What is its adjustment (semantically `in,out,dout → din`) typed as? If change of type is the same as type, then the adjustment is typed `(many In Out Out) → In` (well, `adjust` passes 3 arguments and not 1 tuple, so we'll need a thin extra layer: `_SingleFunc`).    \n",
    "Assuming here that generation is equally possible in both directions, and that every type implicitly includes `None`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alright, generation is simple enough. But what's a good optimizer for what is generated here?    \n",
    "Clearly, adjustment is used for static-structure learning, so we need to measure that.    \n",
    "Static learning: repeat `fit_dataset` *some* count of times (100?), then return *some* measure of fitness (the final loss, or the average loss, or some other numbers→number function I can't prescribe; all divided by time taken, to measure speed).    \n",
    "This is used in dynamic learning: remember the past, do a random change, get fitness, go back if didn't improve, update if improved. (Local search, as described in `help(Past)`.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Your keen eye instantly thinks that those *some*s above exist to be learned, to be inlined and fiddled with in some greater context to get more performance on some tasks. That's true, but we won't do that now. Still, good job catching that.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, it should be said that the result of static learning will always be random in some sense, so there's no guarantee that dynamic learning will improve an objective interpretation of what it optimizes, and it could easily be thrown off by outliers. Ideally, it should sometimes re-calculate best fitness, to average errors out; we don't do that here."

    "- Life has no unifying structure that defines it, therefore, there's nothing more \"alive\" about humans than about a sand beach. But a self-subversive generative process is markedly and obviously different from a non-generative one. (*something* ≠ *everything*)\n",
    "- Any life is as good as any other, so there is no need to fully understand all details of someone else if you can just understand them as a different yourself.

Efficient *everything*s are definitely embedded, however, as anyone who's ever *not* been a creative super-genius for their whole life can attest, static human instincts define most of their existence, and are hard to subvert: much to improve upon.

    "To surprise, to delight… Is that right? It's nice to not fight, to listen to a gentle light. Glad you could join us, even if only for a fleeting moment.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is always a choice: life or death, cookie or ash, read or play, constructive or criticism.    \n",
    "The best we can do is try to see what each choice means, to know what's the best one.    \n",
    "To get so far, your choices must have made you something special.    \n",
    "But don't forget to take a nice relaxing break.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'd like our <code><b>one</b>(*options)</code> type to mean a choice of types.    \n",
    "There was `match_id` in the previous section, so we have some experience with pattern-matching.\n",
    "\n",
    "Crafty hacker, do you prefer the hollowness of a specific definition, warts and bugs and all… or the richness of what it's supposed to be?    \n",
    "`one(…)` represents a union type. These are an essential part of representing all data types in an elegant language: say, <code>Tree<b>(</b>a<b>)</b> = <b>one(</b>null, Ent<b>(</b>a, Tree<b>(</b>a<b>)</b>, Tree<b>(</b>a<b>)))</b></code> specifies a tree: either nothing, or a node with data typed `a` and two tree children. (Or, if we don't have to worry about doing the same work twice (for example, pure function results are cached, and generation can remember same-type values), then this is a DAG (directed acyclic graph) type.)    \n",
    "Many pretty languages have been build on this paradigm. But what about a generative lens of view?\n",
    "- A function that returns such a `Tree` can pick any branch and likely recurse on itself to create an arbitrary DAG. It can potentially learn to extract a good structure from non-structural input. (For this, `AutoFunc` ought to add itself to its context, and generation should filter away the boring `f(x) = f(x)` trivial-infinite-loop cases. Execution should be resilient to non-trivial infinite loops, but `Limit` does that already.)\n",
    "- A function that takes such a DAG pattern-matches each case in any way. If it also takes and returns the same type (probably a `real` named `ascent_estimate`) with a merging operation, then that's half of `rewrite` right there (`ae = ascent(node, ae_sum)`). (Proper descent, which requires descending into a child only after all its parents gave it estimates, doesn't seem plausible in pure function call regime, and needs tricky-to-generate dict wizardry. …Maybe we could translate `one` inputs into `rewrite`s? How, though?)\n",
    "- A function that takes and returns such a DAG (and a soft `real`) is an arbitrary rewrite rule, optimizable to return the best-performing DAG and its performance.\n",
    "- Functions from and to a generative type of all types, in particular product and union and singleton types, would contain all lists, all DAGs, all execution models, all programs, all behavior, all meaning, all awareness. (This one should probably wait until after we can easily specify more fiddlable choices than `random.randint(0,9) == 0`.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Pretty, but an optimization nightmare compared to `rewrite`.    \n",
    "(But maybe, eventually, it's better to switch to that, to allow different flow, such as \"try several times and pick the best\"? It needs really advanced optimization techniques that I haven't seen, possibly even including proofs. What's better: painstakingly specifying a dependent-type structure, or learning something that behaves like it?)\n",

    "But just one direction isn't enough: if an input's result is uncertain, generation of output must happen only after the uncertainty has been pattern-matched away.    \n",
    "The `renn` example already had a function that dispatches based on object id (named `matcher`). We'd like to have that here too, in `match_id(generate_as)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "When it is `finish`ed generating, it should bail out to the top-level (by raising an exception, `_GenerationResult`).    \n",
    "The top level (`regenerate`) should become a function that does what `matcher` in `renn` does: pattern-match by id.    \n",

    "Let's remember what we want: repeatedly change a DAG structure in some way, and evaluate each structure, to find the best. The 'change' are rewriting rules, 'evaluate' is train for 100 epochs or something like it, but this is the overall gist.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have state, transitions on it, and we want to maximize a final value. You know what this reminds me of? MuZero.\n",
    "\n",
    "MuZero is an algorithm for playing games. The 'game' here means \"given state (of a Go board, etc) and action (where to place the stone), give new state and reward (whether lost/won/playing)\", where we want to maximize the cumulative (or final) reward (after transitioning between states).    \n",
    "That algorithm does that by learning the virtualization of state into a numeric representation, learning state transition, and learning search results. Very neat: everything virtualized.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the surface level, it's very similar to what happens in local search, so maybe it could be used there. But details are… complicated.\n",
    "\n",
    "To formalize what we want a little bit: we have some data structure (code), the ability to run it (giving us whether a program compiles and its fitness) and to change it (which can modify any part).    \n",
    "(This is a tad more exciting than playing games: what if our code representation is Turing-complete, and the system can learn to write better versions of itself?)\n",
    "\n",
    "Immediately, there is a problem: there isn't a finite set of actions that we can do. So let's look at what we actually have.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We have a DAG given by recursive arrays, and we descend into it then ascend, and when we ascend, we can choose to either keep the node the same or make it into any one of `Context.enum(Context.typeof(node))`, which can create a new instance or choose an old DAG. (Note that now, we shouldn't ever call `Context.get` ourselves, but instead return `finish(type)` in the graph, to give the parent control over the choice.)    \n",
    "So we have a finite choice. But it's a local choice, whereas the search happens on global results.    \n",
    "There is only one possibility here: to predict the global policy/fitness locally.    \n",
    "Locally, we have numeric ascent/descent estimates and message from descent to ascent, but we also must condition on the option.\n",
    "2. There are several kinds of options we'll see: a DAG structure, and an object with a unique ID (such as a type that generates structure). A recursive NN should handle structure, and a separate numeric variable should be created for each unique object.    \n",
    "A lot of these structures are mostly shared, so we need to cache them. We'll need a recursive NN that only ascends, as it does not depend on the entry point.    \n",
    "We should have a function that produces a function that can be called on an option: `option_handler(feature_size)(option)`. Also, `rewrite` should call `ascend` on non-structs, for uniformity and to store more state.\n",
    "3. Built-in functions are black-box, and can be pattern-matched by object ID to have their own NNs. But what about white-box sub-functions?    \n",
    "We could treat these as black-boxes too, learning the role for each function separately, but this won't be able to predict post-change things.    \n",
    "We need to recurse into bodies of these little devils. Which means that we need to rebrand `ascend` into \"given descent estimate, give ascent estimate\".    \n",
    "Function bodies are acyclic, but for arbitrary recursion, functions themselves can be cyclic. We can either take inspiration from graph NNs and do several iterations of message-passing on the function graph (can't easily imagine how to *not* upend all control flow with this), or for cyclic references, have 1 or more sub-estimators that predict the final ascent estimate, or just make currently-being-handled references pass their message through.    \n",
    "Now, I know that people are supposed to spend tens of thousands of hours on things that don't pan out, but I *think* I'm attracted to the last option.\n",
    "\n",
    "With all that, we *should* be able to predict global estimates locally and search for the best option. With a good enough model, we could do many rewrites without evaluating, to arrive to the best option and just evaluate that once.    \n",
    "It may be slow to do a search 1000 times per rewrite, but, you know, **compute**. Pretty sure that it can learn to be *much* better than things like evolution, especially if trained on a Turing-complete function set, and every program and goal are specified using those. I don't see any better way to do arbitrary white-box optimization that is necessary for general AI; do you?\n",
    "\n",
    "If it bleeds, we can kill it. So, I'll recap what I'll do, and you can follow along if you like:\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ `rewrite` should call `ascend` on non-structs. For this, just put non-structs into `_postorder` and push the struct check onto its users.    \n",
    "(Later, changed `_postorder` back to contain only structs, for efficiency of evaluation. Didn't end up using `rewrite` after all.)    \n",
    "✅ Everything that uses `rewrite` (from Ctrl+F, `regen_t` in `test_rs_1`, and `matcher` in `renn`, and `regenerate`'s `_regen_node` and `_clear_body`) should handle non-structs properly too.    \n",
    "✅ Re-run and test everything.\n",
    "\n",
    "Behind this format lies an effective task executioner. Nurture.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Ctrl+F `Context.get` to gauge the plausibility of inverting control over replacing.    \n",
    "The only odd cases are `access_many` and `_dense_layer_of_concat` (which uses `Context.finish` to pick every enumeration at once); probably good to leave as-is.    \n",
    "❎ Have a class `of_type(Type)` as a replacement for `Context.get` for structs returned from `.finish`, rewrite that in `Context.finish` into instances of the type, and change all `Context.get` to this.    \n",
    "A way to rewrite that is to have `depth=1` parameter to this `finish`, make users remember to pass in the proper value in uncommon situations, and have a global variable in `Context.finish` for max depth.    \n",
    "Another way to rewrite that is to maintain a set of node id in `rewrite` (or any other user of `Context.get`/`Context.finish`), and check that constantly (and set it in a global var). Dict/set stores are less efficient than just postorder, but this is a much more general/convenient way to not go into already-seen things.    \n",
    "✅ Have `with _Seen():` (used in `rewrite` and all `.has`-needing places) and `_Seen.set(k,v)`/`.get`/`.has` for the above."

    "Still, the ×10 game is very poor to showcase this algorithm. I mean, it does give 500-digit numbers almost instantly (where enhanced random choice struggles to give 30), but it's not because of any advantages of machine learning, it's just because the RNN transition devolves to identity (not to zero thanks to `.fill_diagonal`) at large enough call sequence lengths, and estimates of the same things (that depend on RNN state and the thing) are exactly the same, so we're basically learning a flat choice and then have 1%-chance-to-pick-randomly decide when to stop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Worthless. Curse your recursive children, ×10.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, I wanted to also put that rewriting framework into the scaffolding framework, but now I don't.\n",
    "\n",
    "I even wrote the code and everything. It *was* maximally natural to go from \"at this stage, we can do X or Y to Z\" to `state.result(X, Y, Z)`, and code was hardly any longer than pure creation, but that's all I can say.\n",

    "- ❎ Best rewrites of function bodies for that ×10 game: many times, rewrite to maximize result.\n",
    "  - ✅ The basic loop.\n",
    "  - ✅ The (replayed) rewrite function. Pre-add the postorder to a list, then, at each node, have a choice of whether to rewrite-us (creating a new body) or rewrite-args or return.Still, though. Choices using this scaffolding are reinforcement learning. And if there's one thing that reinforcement learning is supposed to be able to do, it's OpenAI Gym environments.    \n",
    "(…Okay, enough linking from me. You're supposed to be able to use Internet search engines to look into what interests you. The only person that can hold your hand is you.)\n",
    "\n",
    "I predict that the results will be the same as when I ran MuZero: almost no improvements in the time I'm willing to allocate to it.    \n",
    "This will be my most difficult challenge to date. Estimation of viability of scaffolding hinges on this not being super-dumb. Let's see if I can do this.    \n",
    "Victory condition: reach episode length of 200. I don't think it goes any higher.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ OpenAI Gym's cartpole-v1: many times, balance until it falls. Choices maximize the sum of rewards. Multithreaded training of replay buffers (failed this one).\n",
    "  - ✅ Create everything that we can without Internet: the basic loop (gather XP then `examples.fit` the choice), the gather-experience-until-end loop (setting future sum), the replayed choice-of-N function (that makes scaffolding see the input cartpole state through a NN).\n",
    "  - ✅ Understand the Gym's interface, then use it here.\n",
    "  - ✅ Run & fix.\n",

    "Day 1 of cartpole balancing. The algorithm isn't well suited for the problem: significant deviations from the norm cause the first choices be adjusted too much, so then performance instantly devolves into \"pick one direction forever\". Other than that frequent self-doubt, simply predicting the reward sum works fine-ish, and often reaches 50 reward.    \n",
    "I need to do two things: ✅ put the whole experience into one function so that there aren't 50 replays per episode, and ✅ predict the value that I ignore: next observation from RNN-state and action given previous observation.    \n",
    "Yes, predict more. A thing not predicted is a thing averaged, re-learned at every learning step. Not dynamic is static. Nothing can be approached willy-nilly.    \n",
    "Interestingly, with isolated choice replays, it was mostly learning left-right-left-right-left-right; united, periodicity is smoother.    \n",
    "And, predicting the next action-independent observation (but not using it, just inducing the numbers needed for it) seems to increase performance.\n",

Programs grow dangerously uncontrollable because of control, and as the world's infrastructure gets infected with viruses and murders as the global brain attempts to understand existence, humanity abandons it.\n",
    "\n",

Proper types *probably* could be learned, not specified. Even low-level memory management might be learnable, though that sounds like crazy-talk to even me.

    "In formal analyses of AGI, it's common to analyse the average case. But arbitrary-program optimization picks the best instead of a random choice, so such an analysis is useless. It can do anything and be anything, as long as its basic functionality set is Turing-complete and efficient.\n",

    "- Fancy representations (such as higher-order logic, gradual dependent types, homoiconicity, self-knowledge, and interoperability) are not required for general intelligence (and, by themselves, will not lead to it). We can get away with merely augmenting generic computation with sufficiently rich routing of differentiable information. If other things are useful, they'll be learned.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Opening all parts to generation, including a partially-evaluated Turing-complete functionality base, having but subverting all concreteness. This allows to choose choices, choose self, use and train self-awareness, and be general. Intelligent choices open up a lot of possibilities that are unfeasible with random chaos of evolution.\n",
